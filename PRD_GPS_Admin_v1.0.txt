BR-002: A Tour must have at least 1 POI (ideally 2+ for a "route")
BR-003: If a POI is deleted, it is automatically removed from poiIds arrays
POI order in poiIds array defines the route sequence (index 0 = first stop)

8.3 Authentication Data Model
typescript

i n t e r fa c e A u t h S t a t e {
isAuthenticated: bb oo o l e a n ;
username: s t rri n g | n u l l ;
}

Notes:
MVP stores auth state in React state (no persistence)
No password field exposed (validated server-side in future)
Session expires on browser close

12. Technical Constraints
12.1 Technology Stack
Frontend:
Framework: React 18+ with TypeScript
Build Tool: Vite
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Icons: Lucide React
State Management: React useState (no Redux/Context in MVP)
Backend (future):
Not implemented in MVP
Recommended: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS (for geospatial queries)
Map Integration:
MVP: Simulated map canvas (not Google Maps/Mapbox)
Future: Integrate Google Maps JavaScript API or Mapbox GL
12.2 Known Limitations
1. No Image Upload: MVP uses placeholder URLs. Future: implement file upload to cloud storage (S3,
Cloudinary).
2. No Drag-and-Drop: MVP POI reordering described in UI, but not fully functional (requires library like
react-beautiful-dnd).
3. No Real Map: MVP simulates lat/lng conversion. Future: integrate actual map tiles.
4. No Data Persistence: All data resets on browser refresh.
5. No Multi-Language: Only Vietnamese labels. Future: i18n support for English, Chinese, etc.

15. Open Questions
15.1 Data & Business Logic
1. Q1: Should POI deletion show a warning if the POI is used in multiple Tours? Or is silent cascade
sufficient?
Recommendation: Add count warning: "Điểm này đang được dùng trong X tours. Xóa?"
2. Q2: What happens if a Tour has only 1 POI after cascade deletion? Does it become invalid?
Recommendation: Allow 1-POI Tours (user can manually delete if needed).
3. Q3: Should POI distance field be auto-calculated or manual input?
Recommendation: Auto-calculate in future (based on user location or prev POI in Tour).
4. Q4: How to handle duplicate POI names?
Recommendation: Allow duplicates (ID is unique); future: add warning on save.
15.2 UI/UX
5. Q5: Should drag-and-drop reordering be implemented in MVP? (Currently UI mock only)
Recommendation: Yes, if time permits; otherwise defer to post-MVP.
6. Q6: Should empty Tours (0 POIs) be deletable from list view, or only via edit mode?
Recommendation: Add delete button in list view hover state.
7. Q7: Should there be a "Draft" vs "Published" status for Tours?
Decision: Out of scope for MVP. All Tours are implicitly "draft".

15.3 Technical
8. Q8: What is the expected backend API authentication scheme?
Recommendation: JWT Bearer token with 1-hour expiry.
9. Q9: Should the system support concurrent editing by multiple admins?
Decision: No, out of scope for MVP. Last-write-wins in future.
10. Q10: What is the expected data volume at launch?
Estimate: ~50 POIs, ~10 Tours initially. Scale plan for 500 POIs, 100 Tours.

16. Success Criteria & Acceptance
